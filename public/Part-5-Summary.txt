Part 5 â€“ Strategies to Achieving Your Nutritional Goals Over Time

Key Takeaways

You don't need to hit your calorie/protein goals perfectly from Day 1â€”gradual improvement wins.

Focus on making small, sustainable changes each week.

Learning how different foods impact your calories and macros builds awareness and long-term success.

Substitutions, portion control, and meal timing are tools to helpâ€”not rules to stress over.

Action Steps

Start Where You Are
- Don't aim for perfectionâ€”track and reflect first, then build improvements over time

Apply These 9 Strategies Week-by-Week
- Manage high-calorie foods: Be mindful of dressings, sauces, nut butters, oils, etc.
- Find lower-calorie substitutes: Use your "Substitute List" tab to swap smarter options
- Choose lean over fatty meats: Use the "Table of Proteins" to compare
- Avoid fried foods: Air fry or bake instead of deep-frying
- Make smarter choices when eating out: Apply previous strategies when eating out
- Prioritize full meals over snacks: More satisfying and better for hunger control
- Spread your protein evenly: Aim for 20+g per meal, especially at breakfast
- Add fruits and veggies: Every meal should contain at least one
- Drink water throughout the day: Space your intake for better hydration and performance
- Bonus strategy: Brush your teeth, mouth wash, or chew strong mint gum after meals to reduce post-meal snacking and overeating

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trying to change everything all at once
- Skipping protein at breakfast 
- Overeating snacks due to under-fueling with meals
- Taking for granted how small adjustments can go a long way, especially when compounded over time (Being a little better every week)
