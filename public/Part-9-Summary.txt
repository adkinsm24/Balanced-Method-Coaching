Part 9 – Breaking Through Plateaus

Key Takeaways

Plateaus are normal and expected—especially as you get leaner.

A plateau means your body has adapted, and you're no longer in a deficit.

Before making changes, confirm it's a true plateau (not from inconsistent tracking, water retention, etc.).

Small, consistent adjustments to food or exercise break most plateaus.

Action Steps

Confirm It's a Real Plateau
- At least 2 weeks of no change in weight, girths, or visible progress
- Be sure you're tracking food accurately, weighing consistently, and not retaining water

Use This Checklist to Rule Out a False Plateau
- Are you weighing/measuring food?
- Are you logging everything (snacks, bites, sauces)?
- Has your activity decreased?
- Are you retaining water (menstrual cycle, stress, illness)?
- Are you constipated?
- Are you sleeping enough?

Create a New Deficit (Choose One or Combine)
- Lower calories by 5–10% (mostly from carbs and fats)
- Increase activity by 5–15% (add sets, reps, or minutes to workouts)

Wait 2 Weeks, Then Reassess
- Don't rush adjustments. Let your body respond

Example: Combining Adjustments
- Lower calories by 3–5%
- Add 5% more training volume (e.g., extra reps or time)

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Cutting calories too aggressively
- Making changes after just 1 week of stalled progress
- Ignoring lifestyle factors like stress, sleep, hydration, or digestion
