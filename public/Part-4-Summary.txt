Part 4 â€“ Roadmap to Achieving Your Nutritional Goals

Key Takeaways

Structuring your meals around protein and calorie goals is the foundation of fat loss.

A balanced plate includes: lean protein, quality starch, vegetables or fruits, and healthy fats.

You must plan your meals around your schedule and habits to stay consistent.

Building a Go-To Meals list helps maintain variety while hitting your targets.

Action Steps

Determine Your Meal Frequency
- Decide how many meals you eat per day and per week

Calculate Per-Meal Targets
- Divide your daily calorie and protein goals across your meals
- Example: 2000 cal & 150g protein split into 4 meals = 500 cal & ~38g protein each

Account for Eating Out
- Subtract expected restaurant meals from your total meals
- Plan to prep the rest or order from a meal prep service

Build Your Balanced Meals
- Use the "balanced plate" template
- Choose foods you like from each category: lean protein, starch, veggies/fruits, healthy fats
- Refer to the Table of Proteins, Carbs & Fiber, and Calories in Foods spreadsheets

Create & Save Your Go-To Meals
- Find meals that hit your numbers and are easy to prepare
- Save them in MyFitnessPal or a personal list to rotate regularly

Check Your Daily & Weekly Averages
- Use MyFitnessPal to confirm you're hitting calorie and protein targets
- Review averages at the end of the week (go to Sunday > Food > Weekly View)

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Picking meals without checking if they meet your calorie/protein goals
- Relying too heavily on eating out without planning ahead
- Not adjusting meals over time to keep variety and prevent boredom
