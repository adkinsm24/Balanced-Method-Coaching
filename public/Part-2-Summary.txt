Part 2 â€“ Logging on MyFitnessPal

Key Takeaways

Accurate food logging is essential for understanding your intake and making the right adjustments.

Use grams and a kitchen scale for the most precise entriesâ€”avoid logging in cups or ounces when possible.

Always verify nutrition entries in the app by checking the calories, macros, fiber, sodium, and saturated fat.

Create custom foods or meals when needed to avoid repeated searches and ensure accuracy.

Action Steps

Get a Digital Kitchen Scale
- Inexpensive and available in most stores or online
- Essential for weighing packaged and cooked items

Log Using Grams
- When possible, choose gram-based entries (e.g., 1g x serving weight)
- Weigh items before cooking for the best accuracy

Verify Nutritional Information
- Match calories, macros, fiber, sodium, and sat fat with food labels
- Prefer entries with a green checkmark, but always double-check

Create Custom Foods
- For packaged items not found in the app or when using international versions
- Go to: More > My Meals, Recipes & Foods > Foods > Create a Food

Create Meals & Recipes
- Group items you eat together often
- Save meals (like a protein shake or burrito bowl) to save time
- Use "Create a Recipe" for mixed dishes like chili, stew, etc.

Log All Food & Beverages
- Don't forget sauces, snacks, bites while cooking, or restaurant meals
- Estimate when necessary, but aim for consistency over perfection

Log Meals Out 
- Search for the restaurants' nutritional guide online
- Use ChatGPT or other AI tools to help with logging your meals out

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Logging by volume (e.g., cups) instead of weight (grams)
- Trusting inaccurate entries without cross-checking
- Skipping sauces, oils, or snacks
- Assuming all meat logs are the same (check brand or label)
