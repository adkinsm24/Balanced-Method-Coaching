Part 10 – Post-Goal Mindset

Key Takeaways

Hitting your fat loss goal isn't the end—it's the beginning of maintaining your success.

You can choose to keep tracking, reduce tracking, or stop entirely—depending on your preferences and habits.

Reverse dieting is a valuable tool to restore metabolism and maintain results with more flexibility.

The biggest risk post-goal is going back to old habits.

Action Steps

Choose Your Next Phase
- Maintain current routine and tracking if it feels easy
- Reduce tracking but keep prepping meals and making mindful choices
- Stop tracking only if strong habits are in place

Reverse Diet If Needed
- If you're too lean or fatigued, slowly increase food intake to restore metabolism while maintaining your results
- Increase calories gradually by 2–3% per week
- Prioritize carbs > fats if possible
- Adjust protein slightly lower (to ~0.8g/lb body weight) if desired

Monitor Changes
- Watch for weight gain beyond 0.5% per week
- Reduce calories back down if fat gain becomes noticeable or uncomfortable

Avoid the "Food Bender" Trap
- Don't undo your results with unrestricted eating post-diet
- Plan ahead for vacations, holidays, or high-calorie events
- You are the most susceptible to putting weight back on after being in a calorie deficit (post-diet)

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Stopping all structure after hitting your goal
- Not planning for life events (vacations, weddings, etc.)
- Believing that tracking forever is the only way to maintain
