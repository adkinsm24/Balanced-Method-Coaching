Part 8 â€“ Progress Expectations & Interpreting Check-In Results

Key Takeaways

Progress takes timeâ€”fat loss is not always visible week to week.

Expect weight fluctuations due to water retention, sodium, hormonal cycles, and training.

Girth and body fat % changes happen more slowly but provide a clearer picture of fat loss.

Learn to recognize subjective wins like better energy, improved mood, and looser clothes.

Knowing what to expect helps you avoid premature changes or quitting a plan that's working.

Action Steps

Know What's Normal
- Weight can fluctuate 1â€“4 lbs daily
- Fast drops in Week 1 are often water, not fat
- Sustainable fat loss: ~0.4â€“0.8% of bodyweight/week

Use These Progress Benchmarks
Weight loss (weekly) based on different starting weights:
- 250 lbs: 1â€“2 lbs/week
- 200 lbs: 0.8â€“1.6 lbs/week
- 150 lbs: 0.6â€“1.2 lbs/week
- Body fat % loss (monthly): 0.5â€“1.5% is normal
Girth changes (monthly):
- Waist: 1â€“2 inches
- Hips: 0.5â€“1.5 inches

Track and Compare Consistently
- Log all measurements on the same day/time each week
- Look for trends over 2â€“4 weeks, not just 1 week

Apply the 5 Rules of Progress Check-In
- All 3 measurements dropping = Stay the course
- Weight dropping but no change in girths = Be patient
- Waist shrinking but weight increasing = Likely muscle gain
- No data change, but clothes fit better = Still progress
- 2+ weeks of zero change = Possible plateau (revisit Part 9)

Celebrate Subjective Progress
- Looser clothing, increased definition, better energy, improved gym performance

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Expecting linear progress week to week
- Ignoring positive changes that don't show up on the scale
- Making changes to your plan too soon
