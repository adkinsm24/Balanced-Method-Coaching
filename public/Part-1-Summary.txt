Part 1 â€“ Downloading MyFitnessPal

Key Takeaways

MyFitnessPal is the primary tool you'll use to track food, drink, and progress throughout the course.

You do not need the premium versionâ€”the free version has everything you need.

The app's calorie recommendation doesn't matter; you'll be given personalized goals in later modules.

Turn off step tracking to prevent automatic calorie adjustments that could interfere with your targets.

Action Steps

Download the App
- Find "MyFitnessPal" in your app store and install it

Create a Free Account
- Use any email and password (10+ characters)
- Accept all terms to continue

Skip the Built-In Recommendations
- Click through prompts without overthinking (e.g., activity level, weight goal)
- These defaults are irrelevantâ€”you'll override them later

Disable Step-Based Adjustments
- Uncheck "Use my phone to track steps"
- This prevents the app from modifying your calorie goal based on steps

Exit Setup & Close the App
- Once you reach the final screen, close out
- Do not start logging food yetâ€”you'll learn how in Part 2

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Assuming the app's calorie/macro suggestions are correct (they're not personalized)
- Leaving step tracking on, which leads to fluctuating calorie targets
- Jumping into food logging without learning how to log accurately (covered in Part 2)
