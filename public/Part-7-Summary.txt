Part 7 â€“ Tracking Progress

Key Takeaways

The scale alone can be misleadingâ€”combine it with waist and hip measurements for a clearer picture.

Consistency in when and how you measure (day, time, tools, clothing) is critical for accurate tracking.

Subjective signs of progress (clothes fitting, energy, strength) matter just as much as numbers.

Daily weigh-ins are optional but can be useful for calculating weekly averages.

Action Steps

Track at Least 3 Metrics Weekly
- Body weight
- Waist circumference (at belly button or narrowest point)
- Hip circumference (widest part of your buttocks)

Follow Consistent Measurement Conditions
- Same day/time each week (e.g., Sunday morning)
- After using the bathroom, before food/water
- Without clothes or using the same tight-fitting outfit

Use the Measurement Tracker Spreadsheet
- Log weight, waist, hips, optional thigh/arm/body fat if desired
- Include notes on workouts and habits to spot trends

Calculate Weekly Weight Averages (Optional)
- Weigh daily if it doesn't cause stress; otherwise, stick to weekly
- Average out 7-day weigh-ins to smooth daily water weight fluctuations

Look for Subjective Progress
- Clothes fitting differently
- Increased definition in the mirror
- Better energy or mood

Optional: Track Body Fat with Tools
- Use the same method/device monthly (DEXA, InBody, BIA scale, calipers, etc.)
- Accuracy varies widely between devices, but trends are still useful

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Relying only on the scale to judge fat loss
- Measuring at inconsistent times or with different tools/clothing
- Ignoring non-scale victories or subjective improvements
