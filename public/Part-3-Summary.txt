Part 3 â€“ Establishing Your Nutritional Goals

Key Takeaways

Fat loss is driven by consistently eating fewer calories than you burn (caloric deficit).

Protein is crucial for preserving muscle mass and achieving a lean, toned appearance.

The ideal protein intake is between 0.8â€“1.2g per pound of body weight.

When calories and protein are controlled, the ratio of carbs to fats matters less for fat loss.

Hydration, fiber, sodium, and saturated fat also impact health and digestion.

Action Steps

Estimate Your Maintenance Calories
- Use the Mayo Clinic Calorie Calculator
- Choose the higher number if you're between two activity levels

Create Your Caloric Deficit
- Multiply your maintenance calories by 0.9 for a 10% deficit
- Example: 1700 maintenance x 0.9 = 1530 calorie goal

Set Your Protein Target
- Multiply your body weight (lbs) by 1.0 (or choose between 0.8â€“1.2)
- Enter your protein goal in MyFitnessPal by adjusting macronutrient percentages to hit your target grams

Adjust Carbs & Fats
- Set carbs and fats so that the total equals 100%
- Aim for carbs and fats to be roughly equal or carbs slightly higher

Set Additional Nutrient Goals
- Fiber: ~25g/day
- Sodium: ~2300 mg/day (don't exceed 3500 mg)
- Saturated Fat: 10% of daily calories (e.g., 153 cal Ã· 9 = ~17g)

Enter All Goals in MyFitnessPal
- Go to: More > Goals > Nutrition Goals > Calorie & Macronutrient Goals
- Use "Additional Nutrient Goals" for fiber, sodium, saturated fat

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Trusting the default MyFitnessPal calorie recommendation (use your own)
- Setting calories too low (may lead to muscle loss, fatigue, slower metabolism)
- Neglecting to track hydration and fiber, which are crucial for digestion and fat metabolism
- Overlooking sodium and saturated fat intake for overall health
