Part 6 â€“ Other Factors Influencing Fat Loss

Key Takeaways

Nutrition alone can lead to fat loss, but physical activity accelerates results and improves body composition.

Sleep, stress, medications, and even genetics can affect your fat loss rate and how your body responds to change.

You don't need to be perfect, but you do need to optimize what you can control.

Action Steps

Incorporate Physical Activity
- Start with any enjoyable movement: walking, biking, fitness classes
- Aim for 8,000â€“12,000 steps/day
- Resistance training is ideal for preserving muscle while losing fat

Sleep 7â€“9 Hours per Night
- Poor sleep leads to muscle loss, fat retention, and increased hunger hormones
- Tips: blackout curtains, consistent bedtime, limit screens, avoid caffeine/alcohol late in the day

Manage Stress Effectively
- High stress = high cortisol = stubborn fat storage (especially around the belly)
- Techniques: deep breathing, nature time, hobbies, meditation, scheduling downtime

Increase NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)
- Burn more calories through everyday movement (walking, cleaning, fidgeting, etc.)
- Take the stairs, pace while on calls, park farther away

Review Medications (if applicable)
- Some prescriptions may increase appetite or make weight loss harder
- Discuss concerns with your doctor if needed

Understand Genetic Differences
- Genetics influence how easily some people gain/lose fat
- You might have to work harder than othersâ€”but progress is always possible

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Ignoring sleep and stress while focusing only on calories
- Assuming lack of results always means dietary failure
- Overtraining without enough food or recovery
