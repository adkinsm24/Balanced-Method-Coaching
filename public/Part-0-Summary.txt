Part 0 – Introduction & Program Overview

Key Takeaways

This course is designed to help you build a sustainable fat loss and healthy eating lifestyle.

Results come from action and consistency, not quick fixes like appetite suppressants or fad diets.

You will learn to track food, set goals, build habits, and make changes that stick.

The program is self-paced, but full commitment and follow-through are necessary to succeed.
